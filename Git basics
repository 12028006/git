Undoing Changes & Recovering History

git reset <file-name>
//Unstages a file, moving it from the staging area back to the working directory (keeping your changes).

git reset --hard <commit-hash>
//DANGEROUS! Discards all local changes in your working directory and staging area, reverting to the state of the specified commit. Use with extreme caution, especially on shared branches.


git restore <file-name>
//(Newer Git versions) Discards changes in your working directory for a specific file, restoring it to the last committed version.

git restore --source=HEAD --staged <file-name>
//(Newer Git versions) Unstages a file. Similar to git reset <file-name>.

git revert <commit-hash>
//Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. This is safer than git reset on shared branches as it doesn't rewrite history.

git clean -n
//Shows what untracked files would be removed.

git clean -f
//DANGEROUS! Removes untracked files from your working directory.

git reflog
//Shows a history of all actions performed in your local repository (even resets, merges, etc.), allowing you to recover lost commits.

git branch
//Lists all local branches.

git branch <new-branch-name>
//Creates a new branch.


git branch -d <branch-name> 
//Deletes a local branch (only if it's merged).

git branch -D <branch-name>
//DANGEROUS! Force deletes a local branch (even if unmerged changes exist).

git checkout <branch-name>
//Switches to an existing branch. (Older method, still widely used).

git switch <branch-name>
//(Newer Git versions) Switches to an existing branch. Recommended for clarity.

git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
//Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it. (Older method).

git switch -c <new-branch-name>
//(Newer Git versions) Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it. Recommended.

git merge <branch-to-merge-in>: 
//Integrates changes from the specified branch into your current branch.

git merge --abort
//Aborts a merge in case of conflicts.

git rebase <base-branch>
// Reapplies your branch's commits on top of another branch's history, creating a cleaner, linear history. Use with caution on shared branches after they've been pushed.

git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
//Applies a specific commit from one branch onto another.

git remote -v
//Lists all remote repositories and their URLs.

git remote add origin <remote-url>
//Adds a new remote repository, typically named origin.

git fetch <remote-name>
// Downloads changes from the remote repository but doesn't integrate them into your local branches.

git pull
// Fetches changes from the remote and immediately merges them into your current local branch. (Equivalent to git fetch followed by git merge).

git pull --rebase  
//Fetches changes and then rebases your local commits on top of the remote changes, leading to a cleaner history. Often preferred over plain git pull.

git push <remote-name> <branch-name> 
//Uploads your local commits to the remote repository.

git push -u origin <branch-name>
//Sets the upstream (tracking) branch for your local branch, so future git push and git pull commands don't need to specify origin and the branch name.

git push --force
//DANGEROUS! Overwrites the remote branch's history with your local history. Only use if you understand the implications and have communicated with your team.

git push --delete <remote-name> <branch-name>
//Deletes a branch on the remote repository.


git stash
//Temporarily saves uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged) in a "stash" so you can switch branches or work on something else.
git stash list: Shows all stashed changes.

git stash pop
//Applies the most recently stashed changes and removes them from the stash.
git stash apply: Applies the most recently stashed changes but keeps them in the stash.

git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Tag message"
//Creates an annotated (recommended) tag at the current commit, often used for releases.

git push origin --tags
//Pushes all local tags to the remote repository.
